# Round-UP
This is currently a simple text based python tournament paring program. This program uses the swiss tournament style of pairings. Currently this is the only pairing type being worked on.
In a swiss style tournament each player is assigned a score based on the round that has been played. After which a player is then paired with another player that has the same or similar score as them.
